# XPEssence
## Introduction
XPEssence is a mod for Minecraft 1.9.4 adding multiple new items, blocks and mechanics based on experience (yes, that green bar with levels on it)
I will use this mod to discover and experiment with Minecraft modding, but I hope it will be also as fun as possible to use.

## Dependencies
This mod should always work with the last _Forge_ version, as long as it's 1.9.4.
