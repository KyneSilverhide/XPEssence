# XPEssence
## Introduction
XPEssence is a mod for Minecraft 1.8.9 adding multiple new items, blocks and mechanics based on experience (yes, that green bar with levels on it)
I will use this mod to discover and experiment with Minecraft modding, but I hope it will be also as fun as possible to use.

## Dependencies
This mod should always work with the last _Forge_ version, as long as it's 1.8.9.

## Getting started
### Items
- **XP Gems**
XP Gem is similar to the "Bottle o' Enchanting", and will give experience to the player when used

- **XP Apples**
Same effects as the XPGem, but also restores a bit more hunger than an apple

- **XP Seeds**
This will allow you to grow XP Gems like any other plants. These grow on tiled dirt, and can be boosted with bonemeal.

### Blocks
- **XP Gem Blocks**
Combine multiple XP Gems to get a block. It can be used for decorative purpose, provides some light, and will also act as bookshelves to improve an enchanting table.

- **XP Gem Glass and glass panes**
Just some decorative glass
